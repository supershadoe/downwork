### downwork

This is a toy project that uses Android views for freelancing purposes. It
supports the following features:

- Freelancers: add, edit, delete services and update profile.
- Customers: view freelancer portfolios.

The app uses SHA256 hashes to store passwords and runs on a SQLite database
which can be changed to a full fledged database in the future.

### future enhancements
- Better design
- Switching to an actual centralized database
- Exposing an API from backend
